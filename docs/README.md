# ![Toggler.io](/docs/assets/logo/black/toggler_io_black-01.svg)

`toggler` is a Self hosted Feature and Release Management Service.

The service designed to be hosted on the public web. The service expects that public web request will be received from
all kind of sources. Such case is the combined usage from SPA, lambda service and traditional backend services.

It is goal to provide a stable, reliable and free rollout management tooling for teams. By using release flags you can
decouple the feature release from the deployment or config change process, also make it simple to keep feature states in
sync for all your users.

The project aims only to be just barely enough for the minimal requirement that needed to do centralised feature release
management.

Other than percentage based feature enrollment for piloting, every custom decision logic is expected to be implemented
by your company trough an HTTP API.

## Getting Started

### Installation

#### Local Development

You need to ensure the following dependencies:

- go compiler (must have)
- bash (should have)
    * some script is written in `bash`
- docker-compose/podman-compose (should have)
    *
        + docker/podman
- [direnv](https://github.com/direnv/direnv) (nice to have)
    * alternatively you can just source the `.envrc` file at the project root directory.

To provision the project, execute the following command:

```sh
. .envrc
./bin/provision
docker-compose up --detach
```

To execute the tests:

```bash
go test ./...
```

#### With Container

You can build toggler from the master branch by using the Dockerfile:

```sh
docker build --tag toggler:latest .
```

or grab from hub.docker.com:

```sh
docker pull adamluzsi/toggler:latest
```

### Configuration

The application can be configured trough either CLI option or with environment variables. It follows the convention that
works easily with SaaS platforms or containerization based solutions.

#### Storage

The storage external resource will be used to persist data, and then using as source of facts.

The toggler doesn't depend on a certain storage system. It use behavior based specification, and has multiple
implementation that fulfil this contract. This could potentially remove the burden on your team to introduce a new db
just for the sake of the project.

You can choose from the following

* [Postgres](https://github.com/postgres/postgres)
* InMemory (for testing purposes only)

The Storage connection can be configured trough the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable or by providing
the `-database-url` cli option to the executable.

To use one of the implementation, all you have to do is to provide the connection string in the CLI option or in the
environment variable.

example connection string:
> postgres://user:passwd@ec2-111.eu-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com:5432/dbname

```bash
export DATABASE_URL="postgres://user:passwd@ec2-111.eu-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com:5432/dbname"
```

#### [Cache](/docs/caches/README.md)

### Deployment

* [heroku](/docs/deploy/heroku.md)
* [AWS Elastic Beanstalk](/docs/deploy/aws/eb/README.md)
* [on-premises](/docs/deploy/on-prem.md)
* [Docker](/docs/deploy/docker.md)

### Usage

#### Security token creation

To gain access to write and update related actions in the system, you must create a security token that will be used
even on the webGUI.

To create a token, execute the following command on the server:

```bash
./toggler -cmd create-token "token-owner-uid"
```

the uniq id of the owner could be a email address for example. The token will be printed on the STDOUT. The token cannot
be regained if it is not saved after token creation.

#### API Documentation

* [HTTP API documentation](/docs/httpapi/README.md)
* you can find the swagger documentation at the /swagger.json endpoint.
* the webgui also provides swagger-ui out of the box on the /swagger-ui path
